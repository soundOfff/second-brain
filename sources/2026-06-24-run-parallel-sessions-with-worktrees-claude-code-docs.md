Skip to main content

A git worktree is a separate working directory with its own files and branch, sharing the same repository history and remote as your main checkout. Running each Claude Code session in its own worktree means edits in one session never touch files in another, so you can have Claude building a feature in one terminal while fixing a bug in a second. This page covers worktree isolation in the CLI. Everything below assumes a git repository. For other version control systems, see Non-git version control. The desktop app creates a worktree for every new session automatically. Worktrees are one of several ways to run Claude in parallel. They isolate file edits, while subagents and agent teams coordinate the work itself. See Run agents in parallel to compare the approaches, or skip ahead to Isolate subagents with worktrees to use worktrees and subagents together.

## ​Start Claude in a worktree

Pass --worktree or -w to create an isolated worktree and start Claude in it. By default, the worktree is created under .claude/worktrees/<value>/ at your repository root, on a new branch named worktree-<value>:

claude --worktree feature-auth

To put worktrees somewhere else, configure a WorktreeCreate hook. Run the command again with a different name in another terminal to start a second isolated session:

claude --worktree bugfix-123

If you omit the name, Claude generates one such as bright-running-fox:

claude --worktree

You can also ask Claude to “work in a worktree” during a session, and it will create one with the EnterWorktree tool. Once in a worktree, Claude can switch directly to another one under .claude/worktrees/ by calling EnterWorktree with the target path. The previous worktree stays on disk untouched. Before using --worktree interactively in a directory for the first time, accept the workspace trust dialog by running claude once in that directory. If trust has not yet been accepted, --worktree exits with an error and prompts you to run claude in the directory first. Non-interactive runs with -p skip the trust check, so claude -p --worktree proceeds without it.

Add .claude/worktrees/ to your .gitignore so worktree contents don’t appear as untracked files in your main checkout.

### ​Choose the base branch

Worktrees branch from your repository’s default branch, origin/HEAD, so they start from a clean tree matching the remote. If no remote is configured or the fetch fails, the worktree falls back to your current local HEAD. To always branch from local HEAD instead, set worktree.baseRef to "head" in settings. Setting baseRef to "head" makes new worktrees carry your unpushed commits and feature-branch state, which is useful when isolating subagents that need to operate on in-progress work. The setting accepts only "fresh" or "head", not arbitrary git refs:

{  "worktree": {  "baseRef": "head"  } }

To branch from a specific pull request, pass the PR number prefixed with #, or a full GitHub pull request URL. Claude Code fetches pull/<number>/head from origin and creates the worktree at .claude/worktrees/pr-<number>:

claude --worktree "#1234"

For full control over how worktrees are created, configure a WorktreeCreate hook, which replaces the default git worktree logic entirely.

## ​Copy gitignored files into worktrees

A worktree is a fresh checkout, so untracked files like .env or .env.local from your main repository are not present. To copy them automatically when Claude creates a worktree, add a .worktreeinclude file to your project root. The file uses .gitignore syntax. Only files that match a pattern and are also gitignored are copied, so tracked files are never duplicated. This .worktreeinclude copies two env files and a secrets config into each new worktree:

.worktreeinclude

.env .env.local config/secrets.json

This applies to worktrees created with --worktree, subagent worktrees, and parallel sessions in the desktop app.

## ​Isolate subagents with worktrees

Subagents can run in their own worktrees so parallel edits don’t conflict. Ask Claude to “use worktrees for your agents”, or set it permanently on a custom subagent by adding isolation: worktree to the frontmatter. Each subagent gets a temporary worktree that is removed automatically when the subagent finishes without changes. Subagent worktrees use the same base branch as --worktree, so they branch from your repository’s default branch unless worktree.baseRef is set to "head".

## ​Clean up worktrees

When you exit a worktree session, cleanup depends on whether you made changes:

- No uncommitted changes, no untracked files, and no new commits: the worktree and its branch are removed automatically. If the session has a name, Claude prompts instead so you can keep the worktree for later

- Uncommitted changes, untracked files, or new commits exist: Claude prompts you to keep or remove the worktree. Keeping preserves the directory and branch so you can return later. Removing deletes the worktree directory and its branch, discarding any uncommitted changes, untracked files, and commits

- Non-interactive runs: worktrees created with --worktree alongside -p are not cleaned up automatically since there is no exit prompt. Remove them with git worktree remove

Worktrees that Claude created for subagents and background sessions are removed automatically once they are older than your cleanupPeriodDays setting, provided they have no uncommitted changes, no untracked files, and no unpushed commits. Worktrees you create with --worktree are never removed by this sweep. While an agent is running, Claude runs git worktree lock on its worktree so that concurrent cleanup cannot remove it. The lock is released when the agent finishes. To clean up a worktree that the sweep keeps, run git worktree remove, adding --force if the worktree has uncommitted changes or untracked files.

## ​Manage worktrees manually

For full control over worktree location and branch configuration, create worktrees with Git directly. This is useful when you need to check out a specific existing branch or place the worktree outside the repository. Create a worktree on a new branch:

git worktree add ../project-feature-a -b feature-a

Create a worktree from an existing branch:

git worktree add ../project-bugfix bugfix-123

Start Claude in the worktree:

cd ../project-feature-a && claude

List your worktrees:

git worktree list

Remove one when you’re done with it:

git worktree remove ../project-feature-a

See the Git worktree documentation for the full command reference. Remember to initialize your development environment in each new worktree: install dependencies, set up virtual environments, or run whatever your project’s setup requires.

## ​Non-git version control

Worktree isolation uses git by default. For SVN, Perforce, Mercurial, or other systems, configure WorktreeCreate and WorktreeRemove hooks to provide custom creation and cleanup logic. Because the hook replaces the default git behavior, .worktreeinclude is not processed when you use --worktree. Copy any local configuration files inside your hook script instead. This WorktreeCreate hook reads the worktree name from stdin, checks out a fresh SVN working copy, and prints the directory path so Claude Code can use it as the session’s working directory:

{  "hooks": {  "WorktreeCreate": [  {  "hooks": [  {  "type": "command",  "command": "bash -c 'NAME=$(jq -r .name); DIR=\"$HOME/.claude/worktrees/$NAME\"; svn checkout https://svn.example.com/repo/trunk \"$DIR\" >&2 && echo \"$DIR\"'"  }  ]  }  ]  } }

Pair it with a WorktreeRemove hook to clean up when the session ends. See the hooks reference for the input schema and a removal example.
